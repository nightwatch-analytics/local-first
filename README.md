## The Man in The Arena

It is not the critic that counts; not the man that points out how the strong
man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit
belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by sweat 
and dust and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and 
again, because there is no effort without short coming; but who does actually 
strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms; who at the best knows in 
the end the triumph of high acheivement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least
he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be among those cold
and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.

## INVICTUS

Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be,
for my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance,
I have not winced not cried aloud.
Underneath the bludgeonings of chance,
my head is bloodied, but unbowed,

Beyond this place of wrath and tears,
Looms but the horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
finds me and shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate,
I am the captain of my soul.
